# Timestamp Microservice

This is the first API project from back end development certificate on freeCodeCamp.<br />
The Heroku link is : [https://frozen-hamlet-98229.herokuapp.com/](https://frozen-hamlet-98229.herokuapp.com/).

* User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

* User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

* User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
